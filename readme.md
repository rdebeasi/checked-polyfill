# Checked Polyfill

This code adds support for the :checked pseudo-class on browsers that don't natively support it. On old browsers, it adds a .checked class that behaves like the :checked psuedo selector. If you use the "for" attribute on your label, it will also apply the .checked class to your label. That helps work around the [buggy sibling selector support in IE7](http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selectors/#t11).

## Usage

Start by [downloading Checked Polyfill](https://github.com/rdebeasi/checked-polyfill/releases) or [installing it from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/checked-polyfill).

Include the script at the bottom of the page. (If you don't already have jQuery, include that too.)

```html
<script src="checked-polyfill.js"></script>
```

In a script tag or a separate .js file, call the polyfill on elements that you'd like to style.

```javascript
$( document ).ready(function() {
	$('input:radio, input:checkbox').checkedPolyfill();
});
```

Finally, use :checked and .checked to style your radio buttons. You'll get native support in modern browsers, and JS-based support older browsers (e.g., in IE7 and IE8). Put these selectors on separate lines.

```css
.myStyledLabels label.checked {
	background-color: #ccc; /* For older browsers */
}

.myStyledLabels input[type="radio"]:checked + label {
	background-color: #ccc; /* For modern browsers */
}
```
